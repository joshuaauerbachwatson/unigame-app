# unigame-app
This is the assembled app store submission bundle including all unigame games.  

As part of the overall plan, `unigame` will soon have the ability to support bundles with multiple apps.  I've decided that, rather than submitting individual
`unigame` apps to the app store, I will design and use this new facility to create a single app containing all the then-current games.  Hopefully, I will be able to 
add more games in subsequent releases (subject to app store review, of course).
